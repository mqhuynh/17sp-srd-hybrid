# The source srd-app client

This directory also contains the [`config.ts`](config.ts) file. Modify the file to make changes to the look and feels.

## Directory structure
```
./app/ -> app.module.ts and base angular component
./pages/{page_name}/ -> A page, eg, a search page and list item details page
./providers/ -> Custom Providers for Angular components
./theme/ -> Modify these values to change system theme
./pipes/ -> Custom pipes
./assets/ -> all assets on the client app
./components/ -> The Angular components (that are not pages)
```

Try not modifying anything else. They are generated by `ionic start <proj_name> blank`


## Note for developer
* We're using the angular router even though the hash in the URL is not changing.
* Pages themselves are components. 
* Since colors are dynamic, we are passing in `styles` while declaring `@Component({})`. Make sure that 
  `encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None` is also passed.
